      company: <a href="mlsyslab.github.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Digital Media Laboratory</a>, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran
      details: |
        In 2021, I joined the Digital Media Laboratory (DML) as a research assistant under the supervision of 
        <a href="http://sharif.edu/~rabiee/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Hamidreza Rabiee</a> and <a href="http://ce.sharif.edu/~a_hosseini/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Abbas Hoseini</a>.
        My major involvement with this team is in my thesis project aiming to develop an effective recommender system based on queries and the history of users' behavior.
        Regardless of the undeniable importance of this field in e-commerce, my most noteworthy research experience has been developing an embedding-based recommender system from scratch with TensorFlow where
        in addition to the queries, personalization has been taken into account for item ranking.
    
    - role: NLP Engineer
      time: Jul 2019 – Jul 2020

      details: |
        In July 2019, I joined a start-up called Pido, One of the largest Fuel Delivery companies in the Middle East. I mainly worked on a project which helped advertisers target relevant users to get the most purchases. In this project, we developed a recommender system based on users' and products' metadata and the history of purchases. An offline implementation of this project based on our method is now deployed in the company's application.
        In this project, I proposed a novel method that is capable of classifying users and products into groups and match them based on their semantic embeddings.
