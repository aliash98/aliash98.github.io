experiences:
    - role: <strong> Research Assistant </strong>
      time: Jul 2021 - Present
      company: <a href="https://mlsys.darkube.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MLSys Laboratory</a>, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran
      details: |
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> In 2021, I joined the MLSys Lab as a research assistant under the supervision of 
        <a href="http://sharif.edu/~rabiee/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee</a> and <a href="http://ce.sharif.edu/~a_hosseini/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Abbas Hoseini</a>.
        My primary involvement with this team has been in my thesis project, developing an effective retrieval method based on the content
        of queries and items and the history of users' behavior. Given a query as an input, retrieving and ranking items is critically important
        in e-commerce platforms. My project aims to propose and develop an effective personalized embedding-based ranking algorithm, to improve users' experience.
        The main idea is from Word2Vec, an NLP algorithm that has been broadened to Search2Vec for utilization in recommendation systems. 
        A trained neural network based on the mentioned algorithms produces an embedding space that can effectively place related queries and items near each other.<br>
        Moreover, user clustering, based on users' history of clicks, has been employed to personalize the results of our ranking method. 
        Two datasets, one obtained from torob.ir (one of the largest Persian online shops), and the other from AOL (publicly available on Kaggle), 
        are being used for experimenting.  
        Implementation of this project with TensorFlow plus weekly progress reports are available in 
        <a href="https://github.com/aliash98/Search2Vec-BScThesis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this github repository</a>.

    - role: <strong> Research Assistant </strong>
      time: Sep 2021 – Present
      company: Meta-Learning Lab, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran
      details: |
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> In September 2021, I started my contribution to the private meta-learning method project in September 2021 by joining the
        meta-learning group. The supervisor of the lab is <a href="http://sharif.edu/~rabiee/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee</a>. We are investigating
        the threats of reconstruction attacks on meta-learning models, and are proposing a proper defense mechanism for addressing this vulnerability.

    - role: <strong> Data Scientist </strong>
      time: Nov 2019 – Sep 2020
      company: <a href="http://pido.co.ir/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pido</a> (Ayric Parsian E-Commerce)
      details: |
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> In July 2019, I joined a start-up called Pido, One of the largest Fuel Delivery companies 
        in the Middle East. I mainly worked on a project which helped advertisers target relevant users to get the most revenue. 
        In this project, we developed a recommender system based on users' and products' metadata and the history of purchases. Our approach 
        was to classify users and products and match them based on their semantic embeddings. An offline implementation of this project 
        based on our method is now deployed in the company's application. Moreover, as a minor project, I have developed a feedback analyzer 
        method that extracts insights from users' reviews corresponding to each service provider.</p>
    
    - role: <strong> Supervisor of the Department of Chemistry Olympiad </strong>

      details: |
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        After I finished my career in the chemistry olympiad as a student, I started my job at Helli-3 high school. I designed a 
        professional curriculum with the help of experienced teachers, organized exams and evaluations, and supervised talented students 
        (5 - 10 students per year) to prepare them for the olympiad competition. As the mentor and academic advisor of the Chemistry Olympiad team,
        I have helped my students achieve outstanding results. At <a href="https://www.icho2021.org/icho2021/results/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IChO 2O21 in Japan (53<sup>rd</sup> International Chemistry Olympiad)</a>, Mahbod Alian, a team 
        member, won an international gold medal. In addition, he and one of the other students of the department have won national gold and 
        bronze medals, respectively. </p>
